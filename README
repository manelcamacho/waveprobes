Code used to calibrate wave probes and obtained the standar deviation on each measurement, wave probes were calibrated by inserting them into the water column
using a bar with pre-made incisions; the calibration followed the recommendations of the Wave Instrumentation Database as:
MARINET Report Work Package 2: Standards and Best Practice.
Report available at: https://tethys.pnnl.gov/sites/default/files/publications/D2.01_Wave_Instrumentation_Database.pdf

The code has two small scripts that are used to:
1.- Calibrate wave probes input voltage vs water column height (Wolfram Language).
2.- Order wave data into individual files and clean possible blank data spaces caused by malfunctions (Matlab code).

Wolfram Lamguage is free to use and its free for plattaforms as the Raspberry pi, however MATLAB will need a valid license of the software. 
The scripts however are simple and could be easily translated into OCTAVE/R/Python easily.
